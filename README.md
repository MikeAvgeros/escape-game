# User Experience Design - UX

## Strategy

My Milestone Project 2 from the Code Institute is a modern twist of the classic text adventure game. The story of the game will be displayed via text and images, whereas the players can view their stats and inventory with the use of icons and text. To progress through the rooms and finish the game, players will have to choose the right actions presented to them in the form of buttons. In order to make the game more interesting, the players will have to fight monsters and level up their skills and stats.

- **User Stories**

	- As a User, I want to be presented with a well structured game, so I can intuitively navigate and access the information I seek.
    - As a User, I want to be able to understand and enjoy the presented story.
    - As a User, I want the displayed images to convey the emotion of the story.
	- As a User, I want to be able to update my character's stats and weapons to help me beat the enemies.
	- As a User, I want the UI to be consistent throughout the game, so it will be visually appealing and easy to play it.
	- As a User, I want to have a way to save my progress, so I don't have to start the game from scratch every time.
	- As a User, I want a way to visualise how I am doing in the game, and how many more rooms are left till my character escapes.
	- As a User, I want the game to give me feedback every time I choose correct actions that progress the story or raise my character's stats.

## Scope

## Structure & Skeleton

I have designed the structure and skeleton of my game using Miro. You can view the low fidelity wireframes below.
