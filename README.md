# User Experience Design - UX

## Strategy Plane

My Milestone Project 2 from the Code Institute is a modern twist of the classic text-based choose your own adventure game. The story of the game will be displayed via text and images, whereas the players can view their stats and inventory with the use of icons and images. To progress through the levels and finish the game, players will have to choose the right action presented to them in the form of buttons. In order to make the game more interesting, players will have to fight enemies and level up their stats with items and weapons they can pick.

I chose this type of game as it showcases a lot of object oriented design patterns and concepts as well as being heavily interactive and data driven.

- **User Stories**

	- As a User, I want to be presented with a well-structured game, where I can easily find all the information that I need.

  - As a User, I want to be able to easily view information on how to play the game.

  - As a User, I want to be able to name my character similar to RPG games.

  - As a User, I want to be able to understand and enjoy the presented story.

  - As a User, I want the displayed images to convey the emotion of the story.

  - As a User, I want to be able to update my character's stats and weapons to help me beat the enemies.

  - As a User, I want the UI to be consistent throughout the game, so it will be visually appealing and easy to play it.

  - As a User, I want to have a way to save my progress, so I don't have to start the game from scratch every time.

  - As a User, I want a way to visualise how I am doing in the game, and how many more rooms are left till my character escapes.

  - As a User, I want to be able to contact the developer to offer feedback.

## Scope Plane

This project is an MVP with a short story and minimal feature to showcase the style 

## Structure & Skeleton

I have designed the structure and skeleton of my game using Miro. You can view the low fidelity wireframes below.
